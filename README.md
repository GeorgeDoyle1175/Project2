# Project 2 - SOS Dinner 

This App was created to allow an user to search for any recipe based on limited or specific ingredients they may have available in their pantry. This is intended to facilitate the culinary creations and imagination of users. 
User also have the option to create their own profile where they can save recipes and also add their own creations for other users to enjoy. 


## Page Structure

This webpage uses different handlebars and Tailwind CSS styling for its front end developement. 
The main handlebar contains fixed code such as the Nav bar and has a body appended. It also provided with the log-out option if the user is logged in.

following handlebars are homepage, where the initial searchbox for the user appears. Depending if the user is already registered they may either log in or Register, to then have access to their profile and to submit a new "recipe" into the page's database. 

Sequilize and mySQL were used to manage the database created with hardcode rather than with an API. 

Express Node JS are used create a buildable page in this case conneccting all handlebar and routes.

* As a user, I want to be able to create an account.
* As a user, I want to be able to save recipes that I find so that they will populate each time I am on my account.
